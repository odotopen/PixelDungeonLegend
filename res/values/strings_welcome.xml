        Pixel Dungeon Legend is a modification of Watabou\'s open source Pixel Dungeon.\n
        Project was created to provide players with new experience and content.\n
        Another important part of our project is developing multilingual support for the game.\n
        With every update we try to stay as close to our community as possible.\n
